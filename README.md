# Setup
A series of scripts/setup docs to help setup a new computer - Mac OS specifically. This is all to the end that restarting/cleaning
your dev machine should be a painless and easy process.

## Main Scripts
The global/top level scripts to run. These include many of the most common developer tools I use as well as requirements for more
specific scripts and dev environments.

### brew.sh
Tools
- postgres
- postgis

### cli-tools.sh
Tools:
- GitHub CLI
- Heroku CLI
- AWS CLI (coming)

### zshrc.txt
This file is a copy of a 'completed' zshrc file at the end of setup. While each script/program should handle it's own variables/PATH
properly, this is meant to serve as a reference in case anything is not working as anticipated.
